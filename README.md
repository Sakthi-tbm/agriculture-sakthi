- **Improved Seeds**: Access to hybrid and high-yielding seeds that enhance productivity, disease resistance, and climate adaptability.
- **Soil Fertility Solutions**: Fertilizers—both organic and chemical—providing vital nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to support healthy crop growth.
